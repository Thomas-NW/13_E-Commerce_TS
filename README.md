## Installation
💾 Execute npm install to download the required dependenices: dotenv, express, mysql2, sequelize.


## Usage
💻 First a meSQL db must be generated. I used mySQL Workbench to do so. In order to create the tables for the database please execute node server.js. In order to seed the database please execute node seeds/index.js. Thus the db will be pre-popluated with content. After, the server (mySQL) must be started again to run the application. To start the application, executing server.js.


## Contributing
👪 I send "Thanks" to the bootcamp TA team, especially Radomir Fugiel.


## Tests
